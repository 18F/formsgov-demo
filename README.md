# Form Service

This application was generated using JHipster 5.4.2, you can find documentation and help at [https://www.jhipster.tech/documentation-archive/v5.4.2](https://www.jhipster.tech/documentation-archive/v5.4.2).

This is a "gateway" application intended to be part of a microservice architecture, please refer to the [Doing microservices with JHipster][] page of the documentation for more information.

This application is configured for Service Discovery and Configuration with . On launch, it will refuse to start if it is not able to connect to .

## Development

Before you can build this project, you must install and configure the following dependencies on your machine:

1. [Node.js][]: We use Node to run a development web server and build the project.
   Depending on your system, you can install Node either from source or as a pre-packaged bundle.

After installing Node, you should be able to run the following command to install development tools.
You will only need to run this command when dependencies change in [package.json](package.json).

    npm install

We use npm scripts and [Webpack][] as our build system.

Run the following commands in two separate terminals to create a blissful development experience where your browser
auto-refreshes when files change on your hard drive.

    ./gradlew
    npm start

Npm is also used to manage CSS and JavaScript dependencies used in this application. You can upgrade dependencies by
specifying a newer version in [package.json](package.json). You can also run `npm update` and `npm install` to manage dependencies.
Add the `help` flag on any command to see how you can use it. For example, `npm help update`.

The `npm run` command will list all of the scripts available to run for this project.

### Service workers

Service workers are commented by default, to enable them please uncomment the following code.

- The service worker registering script in index.html

```html
<script>
    if ('serviceWorker' in navigator) {
        navigator.serviceWorker
        .register('./service-worker.js')
        .then(function() { console.log('Service Worker Registered'); });
    }
</script>
```

Note: workbox creates the respective service worker and dynamically generate the `service-worker.js`

### Managing dependencies

For example, to add [Leaflet][] library as a runtime dependency of your application, you would run following command:

    npm install --save --save-exact leaflet

To benefit from TypeScript type definitions from [DefinitelyTyped][] repository in development, you would run following command:

    npm install --save-dev --save-exact @types/leaflet

Then you would import the JS and CSS files specified in library's installation instructions so that [Webpack][] knows about them:
Note: there are still few other things remaining to do for Leaflet that we won't detail here.

For further instructions on how to develop with JHipster, have a look at [Using JHipster in development][].

## Building for production

To optimize the fassappsvc application for production, run:

    ./gradlew -Pprod clean bootWar

This will concatenate and minify the client CSS and JavaScript files. It will also modify `index.html` so it references these new files.
To ensure everything worked, run:

    java -jar build/libs/*.war

Then navigate to [http://localhost:8181](http://localhost:8181) in your browser.

Refer to [Using JHipster in production][] for more details.

## Testing

To launch your application's tests, run:

    ./gradlew test

### Client tests

Unit tests are run by [Jest][] and written with [Jasmine][]. They're located in [src/test/javascript/](src/test/javascript/) and can be run with:

    npm test

UI end-to-end tests are powered by [Protractor][], which is built on top of WebDriverJS. They're located in [src/test/javascript/e2e](src/test/javascript/e2e)
and can be run by starting Spring Boot in one terminal (`./gradlew bootRun`) and running the tests (`npm run e2e`) in a second one.

### Other tests

Performance tests are run by [Gatling][] and written in Scala. They're located in [src/test/gatling](src/test/gatling).

To use those tests, you must install Gatling from [https://gatling.io/](https://gatling.io/).

For more information, refer to the [Running tests page][].

### Code quality

Sonar is used to analyse code quality. You can start a local Sonar server (accessible on http://localhost:9001) with:

```
docker-compose -f src/main/docker/sonar.yml up -d
```

Then, run a Sonar analysis:

```
./gradlew -Pprod clean test sonarqube
```

For more information, refer to the [Code quality page][].

## Using Docker to simplify development

You can use Docker to improve your JHipster development experience. A number of docker-compose configuration are available in the [src/main/docker](src/main/docker) folder to launch required third party services.

For example, to start a postgresql database in a docker container, run:

    docker-compose -f src/main/docker/postgresql.yml up -d

To stop it and remove the container, run:

    docker-compose -f src/main/docker/postgresql.yml down

You can also fully dockerize your application and all the services that it depends on.
To achieve this, first build a docker image of your app by running:

    ./gradlew bootWar -Pprod jibDockerBuild

Then run:

    docker-compose -f src/main/docker/app.yml up -d

For more information refer to [Using Docker and Docker-Compose][], this page also contains information on the docker-compose sub-generator (`jhipster docker-compose`), which is able to generate docker configurations for one or several JHipster applications.

## Continuous Integration (optional)

To configure CI for your project, run the ci-cd sub-generator (`jhipster ci-cd`), this will let you generate configuration files for a number of Continuous Integration systems. Consult the [Setting up Continuous Integration][] page for more information.

## Continuous Deployment

# JHipster generated kubernetes configuration

## Preparation

You will need to push your image to a registry. If you have not done so, use the following commands to tag and push the images:

```
$ docker tag faas 306881650362.dkr.ecr.us-gov-west-1.amazonaws.com/faas-sandb/microservice:latest
docker push 306881650362.dkr.ecr.us-gov-west-1.amazonaws.com/faas-sandb/microservice:latest
```

## Deployment

You can deploy all your apps by running the below bash command:

```
./kubectl-apply.sh
```

## Exploring your services

Use these commands to find your application's IP addresses:

```
$ kubectl get svc faasappsvc
```

## Scaling your deployments

You can scale your apps using

```
$ kubectl scale deployment <app-name> --replicas <replica-count>
```

## zero-downtime deployments

The default way to update a running app in kubernetes, is to deploy a new image tag to your docker registry and then deploy it using

```
$ kubectl set image deployment/<app-name>-app <app-name>=<new-image>
```

Using livenessProbes and readinessProbe allows you to tell kubernetes about the state of your apps, in order to ensure availablity of your services. You will need minimum 2 replicas for every app deployment, you want to have zero-downtime deployed. This is because the rolling upgrade strategy first kills a running replica in order to place a new. Running only one replica, will cause a short downtime during upgrades.

## Troubleshooting

> my apps doesn't get pulled, because of 'imagePullBackof'

check the registry your kubernetes cluster is accessing. If you are using a private registry, you should add it to your namespace by `kubectl create secret docker-registry` (check the [docs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/pull-image-private-registry/) for more info)

> my apps get killed, before they can boot up

This can occur, if your cluster has low resource (e.g. Minikube). Increase the `initialDelySeconds` value of livenessProbe of your deployments

> my apps are starting very slow, despite I have a cluster with many resources

The default setting are optimized for middle scale clusters. You are free to increase the JAVA_OPTS environment variable, and resource requests and limits to improve the performance. Be careful!

> my Postgresql based microservice stuck during liquibase initialization when running multiple replicas

Sometimes the database changelog lock gets corrupted. You will need to connect to the database using `kubectl exec -it` and remove all lines of liquibases `databasechangeloglock` table.
